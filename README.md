# DEPRECATED!  

# gmeet-bot

~~Currently runs Google Chrome v86 and later on Windows 10.~~  
Update: No longer works after the GMeet Update.

Logs in to GMeet, attends your online class, and automatically leaves once 75% of the class has left. Joins with dummy camera and mic, both off. Remember to customise the login-details file with email-id, password and Meet code in consecutive lines. Ensure that there are no whitespaces.

Oh, and don't forget to pay attention to class.


I intend to work on additional features, mainly automated response to attendance, in the future. I will also  be extending the bot to other browsers soon.

Head over to active-dev branch to check out the latest additions.
