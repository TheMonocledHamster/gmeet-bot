# gmeet-bot

Currently runs Google Chrome on Windows 10.


Logs in to GMeet, attends your online class, and automatically leaves once 75% of the class has left. Joins with dummy camera and mic, both off. Remember to customise the login-details file with email-id, password and Meet code in consecutive lines. Ensure that there are no whitespaces.

Oh, and don't forget to pay attention to class.


I intend to work on additional features, mainly automated response to attendance, in the future. I will also  be extending the bot to other browsers soon.

Head over to active-dev branch to check out the latest additions.
